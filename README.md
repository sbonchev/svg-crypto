# Vsg.CryptoBinanceApi

Vsg.CryptoBinanceApi is a extensible solution based on Binance Crypto-Socket for providing real-time and historical cryptocurrency price data. It comprises a web API (`Vsg.Web.Api`) for serving prices data and also a console application (`Vsg.Console`) for command-line interactions including a background service for collecting historical crypto data. The application structure consists also class libraries for managing the data logic and utility help services.
It covers the following requirements:

* Uses the Binance WebSocket API to collect price data for the certain symbols [BTCUSDT, ADAUSDT, ETHUSDT...]
  using ( [https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/web-socket-streams.md](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/web-socket-streams.md) )
  * Store the price information for the symbols in a relational database ( feel free to use any approach at all for data storage, including an ORM )
  * Create an HTTP API which can accept and return both XML and JSON ( depending on `Content-Type` Header ) with the following endpoints:
    * `GET /api/{symbol}/24hAvgPrice` - Returns the average price for the last 24h of data in the database ( or the oldest available, if 24h of data is not available )
      * `{symbol}` - The symbol the average price is being calculated for
    * `GET /api/{symbol}/SimpleMovingAverage?n={numberOfDataPoints}&p={timePeriod}&s=[startDateTime]` - Return the current Simple Moving average of the symbol's price ( More info: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp#:~:text=A%20simple%20moving%20average%20(SMA)%20is%20an%20arithmetic%20moving%20average,periods%20in%20the%20calculation%20average.))
      * `{symbol}` - The symbol the average price is being calculated for
      * `n` - The amount of data points
      * `p` - The time period represented by each data point. Acceptable values: `1w`, `1d`, `30m`, `5m`, `1m`
      * `s` - The datetime from which to start the SMA calculation ( a date )
      
      Examples:
      * `/api/BTCUSDT/SimpleMovingAverage?n=10&p=1d&s=2021-12-15`
        Explanation: Fetch the simple moving average of the BTCUSDT symbol from the last 10 days, starting on the 15th of december, 2021
      * `/api/ADAUSDT/SimpleMovingAverage?n=100&p=1w`
        Explanation: Fetch the simple moving average of the ADAUSDT symbol from the last 100 weeks, starting on the current date
      * `/api/ETHUSDT/SimpleMovingAverage?n=200&p=5m`
        Explanation: Fetch the simple moving average of the ETHUSDT symbol from the last 200 5 minute intervals, starting on the current date
          
  * Use caching on the backend to improve the performance of the application where applicable
  * Also, create a Console application, which can execute the following commands:
    * `24h {symbol}` - Same as the `/api/{symbol}/24hAvgPrice` endpoint
    * `sma {symbol} {n} {p} {s}` - Same as the `/api/{symbol}/SimpleMovingAverage` endpoint
    * Manual handling the Background tracking data storage service (start/stop).

## Introduction
Vsg.CryptoBinanceApi is an implementation based on the Binance web-socket-streams solution 
### endpoint: **wss://stream.binance.com:9443**
### Kline/Candlestick Streams for UTC
The Kline/Candlestick Stream push updates to the current klines/candlestick every second in `UTC+0` timezone
<a id="kline-intervals"></a>
**Kline/Candlestick chart intervals:**

s-> seconds; m -> minutes; h -> hours; d -> days; w -> weeks; M -> months
* 1s
* **1m**
* 3m
* **5m**
* 15m
* **30m**
* **1h**
* 2h
* 4h
* 6h
* 8h
* 12h
* **1d**
* 3d
* **1w**
* 1M
  
Example1:
{"e":"kline","E":1718201531114,"s":"BTCUSDT",
  k":{"t":1717977600000,"T":1718582399999,"s":"BTCUSDT","i":"1w"
  ,"f":3629710335,"L":3633242371,"o":"69648.15000000",
  **"c":"69500.00000000"**,"h":"70195.94000000","l":"66051.00000000","v":"76008.67337000","n":3532037,
  "x":false,"q":"5177867643.67048580","V":"37564.83557000","Q":"2559282362.06050490","B":"0"}}  

**Stream Name:** \<symbol\>@kline_\<interval\>

**Update Speed:** 1000ms for `1s`, 2000ms for the other intervals
* Kline intervals open and close in the `UTC+8` timezone. For example the `1d` klines will open at the beginning of the `UTC+8` day, and close at the end of the `UTC+8` day.
* Note that `E` (event time), `t` (start time) and `T` (close time) in the payload are Unix timestamps, which are always interpreted in UTC.

**Stream Name:** \<symbol\>@kline_\<interval\>@+08:00
### Average price streams push changes in the average price over a fixed time interval based on the closing-price to related closing-time timestamp.
The **closing price** is the raw price or cash value of the last transacted price in a security before the market officially closes for normal trading. It is often the reference point used by investors to compare a stock's performance since the previous day‚Äîand closing prices are frequently used to construct line graphs depicting historical price changes over time.
The closing price on one day can be compared to the closing price on the previous day, 30 days earlier or a year earlier, to measure the changes in market sentiment toward that stock. Most stock news sites allow investors to chart closing prices for a period of years, and typically since the day the company went public.
**Moving average (SMA) is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation average. For example, one could add the closing price of a security for a number of time periods and then divide this total by that same number of periods. Short-term averages respond quickly to changes in the price of the underlying security, while long-term averages are slower to react.**
The formula for SMA is:
**SMA = ùê¥1+ùê¥2+...+ùê¥ùëõ/ùëõ**
where: ùê¥ùëõ = the price of an asset at period 
n=the number of total periods

## Vsg.CryptoBinanceApi solution projects:
### 1. Vsg.Models 
* CryptoKline and CryptoKlineDetails classes for processing the Biance CryptoPrices by JSON serialization (see the ex.1)
* CryptoPrices class for collecting the historical crypto-artifact info to Crypto Kline DB table:
**TABLE [dbo].[CryptoPrices](
	[LastPrice] [decimal](19, 4) NOT NULL,
	[Interval] [varchar](3) NOT NULL,
	[Symbol] [varchar](32) NOT NULL,
	[CloseTime] [bigint] NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PK_CryptoPrices] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
(
	[LastPrice] ASC,
	[Interval] ASC,
	[Symbol] ASC,
	[CloseTime] ASC
)WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON, OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY = OFF) ON [PRIMARY]
) ON [PRIMARY]**
* TimeIntervals enum - VSG def. time intervals (there are subset of Kline's ones)
* Json serialization converters
  
### 2. Vsg.Services
* CryptoDbContextService is implementation of Db sets and settings  based on DbContext class
* RepositoryService<T> is a generic represention of the base CRUD operations,
  the most important in this case is the **"C"-'CREATE'** one, because of the data collection fact issue,
  in this scenario has to be checked already existing data in CryptoPricesTable and insert only unique one.
* CryptoService implements the task required basic operations
  - Get24hAvgPriceAsync(string symbol)
  - GetSimpleAvgMovingAsync(string symbol, int n, string p, DateTime? s)

### 3.  Vsg.Console 
* CryptoClientService works as a BackgroundService for collecting the Biance-socket information for the required crypto currences (**"btcusdt", "adausdt", "ethusdt"**) and related periods (1w, 1d, 1h*, 30m, 5m, 1m), [1h]* period has been added because of 24h calculating task issue:
- create Biance-Kline url: wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@kline_1M/adausdt@kline_1M/ethusdt@kline_1M/btcusdt@kline_1w/adausdt@kline_1w/ethusdt@kline_1w/btcusdt@kline_1h/adausdt@kline_1h/ethusdt@kline_1h/btcusdt@kline_1d/adausdt@kline_1d/ethusdt@kline_1d/btcusdt@kline_1m/btcusdt@kline_5m/btcusdt@kline_30m/adausdt@kline_1m/adausdt@kline_5m/adausdt@kline_30m/ethusdt@kline_1m/ethusdt@kline_5m/ethusdt@kline_30m
* Console application also provides execution the following commands:
- 24h {symbol} - Same logic as the /api/{symbol}/24hAvgPrice endpoint by Get24hAvgPrice
- SMA {symbol} {n} {p} [{s}] - Same logic as the /api/{symbol}/SimpleMovingAverage endpoint by GetSimpleMovingAvgAsync

### 4. Vsg.Web.Api HTTP API implemented in BianceCryptoController which can accept and return both XML and JSON ( depending on Content-Type Header ) with the following endpoints working with JWT authorization:
* 4.1. GET /api/{symbol}/24hAvgPrice - Returns the average price for the last 24h of data in the database ( or the oldest available, if 24h of data is not available ) 
{symbol} - The symbol average price is being calculated for
* 4.2. GET /api/{symbol}/SimpleAvgMoving?n={numberOfDataPoints}&p={timePeriod}&s=[startDateTime] - Return the current Simple Moving average of the symbol's price ( More info: Investopedia)
{symbol} - The symbol the average price is being calculated for: 
- n: The amount of data points
- p: The time period represented by each data point. Acceptable values: **1w, 1d, 30m, 5m, 1m**
- s: The datetime from which to start the SMA calculation (a date)

### 5. Vsg.CryptoBinanceApi application Setup 
* Use MSSQL (Express) Server
* Restore CryptoServiveDb.sql DB sript (creat DB and inserts historical data for testing) lacated in ./Vsg.DataModels
* Fix the connection string in appsettings.json with your own proper one.
* Vsg.Web.Api HTTP API works with JWT authorization - https://jwt.io/
(please, generate your auth-token calling 'GetToken' action and paste it into appsettings.json for the testing)
